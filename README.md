## Linear Algebra & Linear Optimization (Least Squares) Library

This is a simple linear algebra library I am working on to allow for standard matrix computations on $$M_{m\times n} (\mathbb{R})$$. All functionality is being built from scratch and is a precursor to linear machine learning methods.

The end goal is to be able to run various least squares optimization methods given an input of real numbers, and allow this (small regression) model to make predictions
